# LampPack
A bash script to automate the installation of LAMP, phpMyAdmin and Let's Encrypt

## About LampPack
LampPack is a set of some bash/shell scripts that automate several tasks together on your Ubuntu servers. If you are tired of repetitive tasks while deploying Ubuntu servers for web or if you aren't well-versed in server configuration, then these scripts are for you. Automate installation of Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin, Let's Encrypt (free SSL) as well as automate the deploy of WordPress for new domains. For WordPress deployment, I've used [wp-cli](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli), the renowned WordPress deployment command-line tool.
